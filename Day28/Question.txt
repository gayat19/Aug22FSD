Simple shopping app using .NET Core for the backend and Angular for the frontend involves several steps, 
including 
	setting up the project, 
	creating models, 
	implementing CRUD operations, 
	and building the user interface.

**Caselet: Building a Simple Shopping App**

**Scenario:**
You are tasked with developing a basic shopping app that allows users to view a list of products, add them to their cart, and place orders. The app should have a user-friendly interface and a secure backend.

**Requirements:**
1. Backend should be developed using .NET Core.
2. Frontend should be developed using Angular.
3. Users can view a list of products with details like name, price, and image.
4. Users can add products to their shopping cart.
5. Users can view their shopping cart and remove items from it.
6. Users can place an order, which should be stored in the database.
7. Authentication and authorization should be implemented to secure the app.

**Steps:**

1. **Setting Up the Backend:**
   - Create a new .NET Core Web API project.
   - Define models for `Product`, `User`, and `Order`.
   - Implement controllers and actions for CRUD operations on orders.
   - Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

2. **Setting Up the Frontend:**
   - Create a new Angular project.
   - Design a user-friendly UI with components for displaying products, a shopping cart, and order placement.
   - Implement routing to navigate between different views (e.g., product list, cart, and order placement).
   - Use Angular services to make HTTP requests to the backend API for fetching products, managing the cart, and placing orders.

3. **Product Listing:**
   - Display a list of products with details on the product listing page.
   - Include an "Add to Cart" button for each product to allow users to add items to their cart.

4. **Shopping Cart:**
   - Create a shopping cart component to display the items added to the cart.
   - Allow users to view and update the quantity of items in the cart.
   - Implement a "Remove" button for each item in the cart.

5. **Order Placement:**
   - Create a checkout page where users can review their cart and place an order.
   - Implement the order placement logic to send the order data to the backend.
   - Provide a confirmation message after a successful order placement.

6. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement user registration and login functionality in the Angular app.
   - Secure API endpoints by checking user roles and validating JWT tokens.
   - Ensure that only authenticated users can place orders.

7. **Testing :**
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements.
   
8. **Additional Features (Optional):**
   - Implement search and filtering for products.
   - Add product categories and allow users to browse products by category.
   - Implement user profiles and order history.
