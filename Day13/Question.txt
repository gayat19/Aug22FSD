Scenario: Building a Blogging Platform

You are tasked with creating a blogging platform using ASP.NET Core MVC. The platform should allow users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. Each blog post should have a title, content, publication date, and an associated author. Users should be able to view a list of blog posts, click on a post to view its details, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts.

1. **Model**: Design the data model for this blogging platform. Define the classes and relationships needed to represent blog posts, authors, and any other relevant entities. Also, consider how you would handle data storage.

2. **View**: Create the necessary views and templates for displaying the list of blog posts, viewing individual blog posts, and providing forms for creating and editing posts. Ensure that the user interface is intuitive and user-friendly.

3. **Controller**: Implement the controllers to handle user requests and interactions. Define actions for displaying the list of posts, creating new posts, editing existing posts, and deleting posts. Make sure to handle validation and error cases gracefully.

4. **Routing**: Configure routing in ASP.NET Core MVC to ensure that URLs are user-friendly and correspond to the expected actions. For example, `/posts` should display the list of posts, and `/posts/create` should lead to the post creation form.

5. **Authentication**: Consider how you would implement user authentication and authorization. Determine who can create, edit, and delete posts. Implement user registration and login functionality if necessary.

6. **Testing**: Describe how you would test your blogging platform to ensure that it functions correctly. Consider unit tests for controllers and integration tests for the entire application.
